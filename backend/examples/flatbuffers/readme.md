## flatbuffers

To get `flatc` (flatbuffers compiler) you can compile it from [source](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers) using cmake or download a binary distribution from its Github [releases](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/releases) page.

In this example I'm using `flatc` version `24.3.25`. To check your version of `flatc` you can run `flatc --version`.
