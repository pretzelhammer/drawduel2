# drawduel2

Successor to [drawduel](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/drawduel), which was implemented 100% in TypeScript, preact on the frontend and node/express/socketio on the backend, and got to about 40% complete before being abandoned. This re-implementation will be 50% TypeScript and 50% Rust. The frontend will be in react, and the backend will likely use axum/fastwebsockets. Hopefully this implementation reaches 100% completion at some point.
